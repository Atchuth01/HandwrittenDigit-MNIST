# MNIST Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple image classification model using TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) and can be used to classify new images.


## Features

* Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset
* Implemented data preprocessing and normalization
* Used TensorFlow for building and training the model
* Added functionality to load and classify new images

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies
2. Run the `train.py` script to train the model
3. Use the `predict.py` script to classify new images

## Testing
* I used a image named "digit0.png" to predicted the class of that image. You can use your own '.png' image for testing.

## Results
* Model predicting the class with 99% accuracy.

## Dependencies

* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Pillow
* Matplotlib
